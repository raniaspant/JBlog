# Hello there.

I am currently doing my MSc in Computer Science in Southern Illinois University Carbondale, under [Dr. Christos Mousas](https://sites.google.com/site/chrismousas/).

### [](#header-3)What do I like?

I enjoy a good programming challenge but I also enjoy utilizing my programming skills to assist any needs I may have. I want to check out NBA statistics because I want to see if my team is going to win or not, might as well build a Neural Network on this to do it on its own. Stuff like that.

### [](#header-3)But what do I like NOW?

I still enjoy a good programming challenge. But right now I really like studying about Neural Networks and I like doing so while learning more python related attributes. So, python and NN. This is what I like now.

### [](#header-3)Seriously though... what do I really REALLY like?

Well, can't help it, I aspire to be a game developer. My absolute #1 passion is launching Unity3d and toying with all the available tools. I want to expand my knowledge on game developing and game design. Not that interested in the graphics part, more interested in the developing and programming of game mechanics.

### [](#header-3)What do I want?

More programming challenges. I want to keep exercising my mind and keep widening my programming skills.
