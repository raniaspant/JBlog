* ### [](#header-3)[Signal Digital Processing](https://github.com/raniaspant/SignalProcessing)

This project consists of 3 sub-programs.

* User gives DTMF sounds and sampling frequency and after hitting enter he can listen to the sounds accordingly (pretty straight forward). Give input like this : hw1('1 0 7 3 # 6 *',8000) (8000Hz is the recommended sampling freq) There is also an apply of tukeywin window in each DTMF sound.

* Random DTMF sounds consisting a final signal. Give input like this y=[rand(1,200000) hw1('1 2 3 4',44100) rand(1,200000) hw1('5 6 7 8 9',44100) rand(1,281330)]; and then call this hw2(y, 1000) (1000 = bandpass filter usage) For the program (2) these functions are used: hw2.m filters.m points.m minmax.m

* Fun/enjoyable part. There is a ringring.wav file from ABBA here, full of DTMF noises. We don't want these, therefore we use the filters in (2) to cut them off. Just type : hw3 if the line %sound(y,fs) in the program is commented, then just type right after : sound(y,fs)

Developed in MATLAB.

* ### [](#header-3)[Simulation of Hopfield Network in synchronous and asynchronous mode](https://github.com/raniaspant/HopfieldNN)

Developed for my Neural Networks course. The custom vectors used are described in the repository's README file.
The exercise was asking the implementation of synchronous mode for the first 2 vectors and then with all 6 vectors, and the same for asynchronous mode. Of course they can be replaced with custom vectors. The software was implemented in Octave. In each file (synch.m and asynch.m) user can change the initStates variable to define if the program should run with 2 vectors or 6 vectors. Each .m file is printing the results to a synch.txt or asynch.txt file.

Developed in Octave.
