<p align="center"><b>Unity3D - Behavior Trees Implementation</b></p>

2 teams, one human player, rest are agents. 
The uploaded material is not a Unity3d Project but the separate C# files, as instructed by the University to be uploaded (plain code files).
Titles of the files indicate the functionality, there are almost all types of leaves implemented (selector, sequence, parallel selector, etc).

Find the repository [here](https://github.com/raniaspant/BehaviorTrees).
