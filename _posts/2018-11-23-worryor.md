<p align="center"><b>Worryor WIP</b></p>

Î¤his is an narrative based exploration/puzzle game with some great influence from The Stanley Parable. 
I do not want it to be that comical this time though (of course I want some funny elements), I want it to be more like a videogame about 
introverts and what an average introvert is going through everytime they have to speak up, get interviewed, be in front of people etc. 
Here is where the narrator is playing the biggest role, being the moody voice that the main character has inside their head.

### What's the challenge
There is going to be an INTROVERT-O-METER at the top of the screen, showing the current psychological status of the player. If the player 
is having anxiety based on what is happening at each stage (speaking to people, not knocking a door before openning it etc), the
INTROVERT-O-METER is going to fill and fill and fill... when it reached the 1/3 of the bar, the first person camera starts trembling.

### How to drop the meter
Go and lock yourself in the bathroom. The meter is gradually being refilled as you stay locked inside.

### What's next?

* The first level is going to be the character's first interview. That involves a lot of human interaction -> introvert's worst dream.
* More ways to drop the meter
* Design more levels after that and design the closure
* Voice acting
