This is a pet. An academic pet. Ok you get it by now, it is a grad studies human being that serves as a pet.

# But what can it do?

Your little man (soon a woman avatar will also be available) is a grad student. It needs food, it needs sanity. It has an available budget that you have to manage, but keep in mind it will be limited!

# How to earn money?

There are certain _tasks_ that you can assign to your pet. Once these tasks are completed, the pet will be rewarded with money. Spend money to buy food and keep your student healthy.
Current available tasks: Paper Reviewing, Experimenting
